% Testing is restricted to the uk as I do not know anyone to test with outside.
% Socket server is based in europe, so this could lead to longer response times for those outside of europe.

\section{Alpha Testing}
% Steal some from chapter 2, it was infringing on this chapter

% Use this fen: 5b2/8/8/8/8/n7/PP6/K7 b to quickly show a stalemate (move the bishop down right one space)
% In general, use different fens to show efficient testing

% Castling
% En passant
% Promotion
% Edge cases with connections

% Server is not running

% Manually typing in the browser (not giving a join key or new query)

% Reconnect button, interesting case when playing on the train and losing connection under a tunnel

% While viewing inspector panel, it shrinks the page and the mouse presses no longer map correctly to the intended space. Browser issue

\section{User Testing and Feedback}
% Discuss feedback from users
% 0 and O is confusing for join keys
