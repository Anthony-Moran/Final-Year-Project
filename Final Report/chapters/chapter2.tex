The history will show the various stages of this project and how we started off with a blank workspace and ended up with this product now.

\section{Back End}

Although the front and back end of this project have been worked on simultaneously, we will begin by looking at the process for how we designed the back end first. This is due to the fact that the front end depends on the back end in order to function.
We have developed the back end using Python 3.10, the Flask framework and the Flask-RESTful extension to allow for a RESTful implementation of the service. These have been chosen for the backend due to expereince and familiarity, and the quality of the code should reflect this. Additionally, the framework abstracts a lot of the processing involved for developing a REST\footnote{REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is an architecture used to define rules for communication over a network} based service, which meant we could focus more on the business logic of the application.

\subsection{Flask/Flask-RESTful}

Before delving into any web service, there is some boilerplate that is required. This can be seen in one of the early commits to this project where I set up an initial connection to the local host and add my first resource, routed to the base URL. For those unfamiliar with flask-RESTful, the way that it functions is by assigning everthing as a resource *referencing may be necessary*. Each resoucrce can be assigned any of the 4 CRUD operations, i.e. Create, Read, Update or Delete, via a POST, GET, PUT and DELETE request respecitvely. The initial resource only features a get request and it returns the index.html file.
